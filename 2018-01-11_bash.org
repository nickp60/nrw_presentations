** What is a command shell
- interface that interprets instructions between the computer and the user
- Accessed with OSX's terminal, linux's terminal, Windows's Git Bash
- First introduced in 1971, *B*ourne *A*gain *SH*ell (bash) introduced 1979

** why would I use one?

*** Speed
- typing is faster than clicking
- running a command 1000 times is waaaay faster than clicking 1000 times

*** Reproducibility
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appeal)
- scripts allow others to repeat your work
- scripts simplify re-running an analysis for new data
- scripts are eaiser to troublshoot

*** Power
- shared clusters > your computer
- my machine: 120GB hard drive, 16 GB ram, 2 processors
- Syd at NUIG: ~2TB hard drive per user, 32 GB ram per node, 32 nodes with 4 processors each

*** Departmental Applications
- using mothur for community analysis
- SNP calling for NGS sequencing
- RNA-seq analysis

*** case study:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appeal)

convert all your figures from JPEG to PNG for re-submission to a new journal
Download and analyse all archael genomes methane synthesis

# * Installing with a package manager
# ** What is a Package Manager
# Package managers: software that minimizes installation headaches
# System-wide: apt or apt-get
# Python: pip
# Perl: cpan or cpanm
# bioinformatics: conda

# ** example: "tree" command
# list

* Setup
** terminal
 Linux: terminal
Windows: Git Bash
OSX: terminal
*** if using something other than bash, change to bash
** Download Sample Data to Desktop, and unzip

** What is a command shell and why would I use one?

*** Reproducibility
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appeal)
- saves time for repetative tasks
- easier to automate

*** Use Case
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appeal)
Say you need to row

* Navigating Files and Directories
** who and where am I?
- whoami
- bad command
- pwd
** Visualizing the file structure
- ls
*** slashes as root and path separator
*** home directory
- ls -F
- ls --help
*** unsupported flags
- ls -j
- man
*** note issue with man for windows
** Parameters vs arguments
parameters change behaviour
arguments change the context, the target, etc
ls -F Desktop

** Navigating Down the File Strucutre
- cd
- cd Desktop
- cd data-shell
- cd data
- pwd
- ls -F
** Navigating up the file structure
- cd data-shell !
- cd ..
- pwd
*** Note . and .. special dirs, accessible most everywhere
- ls -F -a
*** other hidden files
.bash_profile
*** behaviour without argument
- cd
** Moving seamlessly
cd Desktop/data-shell/data

** two more shortcuts: ~ and -
**** Starting from /Users/amanda/data/, which of the following commands could Amanda use to navigate to her home directory, which is /Users/amanda?
cd .
cd /
cd /home/amanda
cd ../..
cd ~
cd home
cd ~/data/..
cd
cd ..

** How can I specify the location of a file or directory on my computer?
* Working With Files and Directories
- How can I create, copy, and delete files and directories?
- How can I edit files?
* Pipes and Filters
- How can I combine existing commands to do new things?
* Loops
- How can I perform the same actions on many different files?
* Shell Scripts
- How can I save and re-use commands?
* Finding Things
- How can I find files?
- How can I find things in files?
